# Stats O'War CFB Useful Scripts and Data

Here is a collection of scripts and data resources I commonly use and run; I figure they may be of use. 

***
### scrape_transfers.R: Transfer portal scraper
  * Script to gather names, position, size, recruiting rankings (high school and transfer), and destinations of all transfers from [247's Transfer Portal](https://247sports.com/Season/2021-Football/TransferPortal/)
   * Yields transfers.csv (updated intermittantly)
   
***
### teaminfo.csv
  * A list of Team names, mascot, current head coaches, offensive coordinators, and defensive coordinators for easy reference.

More to come!
